# BookMate
 BookMate is a lightweight Library Management System (LMS) front-end prototype built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It’s designed as a developer-friendly demo to learn and showcase a full web application flow: authentication, dashboard, user &amp; book management, and client-side persistence.
